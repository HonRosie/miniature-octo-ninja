#Mini Octa Ninja
Currently mini octa ninja is the very beginnings of the snake game in a terminal. Eventually I would like to turn it into some yet to be decided rogue like game. It will involve miniature things, octopuses and ninjas.


##Instructions to run
To run mini:
```console
python snake.py
```


##Current feature set
The current implementation doesn't follow the rules of snake yet. I wanted to get the basics of random snack generation and snake movement down first before iterating on them to make them behave properly.
* A snack is randomly generated every turn
* Player can control snake's movements every turn using 'wasd' keyboard moves
